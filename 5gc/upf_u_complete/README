PDR lookup experiment:

The follow steps assume you have installed the requried dependenecis:

1. Go to "5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr", compile the PDR engine:
make libmycls.so

2. Configure the PDR classifier in upf_u.c  The default classifier is PartitionSort.
    - Search " interface("ps"); " in the upf_u.c
    - if you want to use PartitionSort, keep it as "ps"
    - if you want to use TSS, change it to " interface("ptss"); "
    - if you want to use LL, change it to " interface("ll"); "

3. Compile the UPF-U:
make

4. Run the UPF-U, please specify the path of the PDR file and the PDR classifier you want to load during initialization
./go.sh 1 <path-to-pdr-file> <pdr-classifier-name>

EXAMPLE:
    ./go.sh 1 /users/sqi009/onvm-upf/5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_20.rules ps
    # Install 20 PDRs in the UPF-U, Use PartitionSort classifier

    ./go.sh 1 /users/sqi009/onvm-upf/5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_30.rules ptss
    # Install 30 PDRs in the UPF-U, Use TSS classifier

Note: the PDR files are under 5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr:
    5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_2.rules
    5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_10.rules
    5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_20.rules
    5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_30.rules
    5gc/upf_u_complete/pdr/fw_40.rules
